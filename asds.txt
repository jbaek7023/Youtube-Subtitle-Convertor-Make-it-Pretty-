 the prediction is basically the answer we get from the algorithm a discrete answer we'll be able to form yes/no where as a continuous answer will be a number normally between zero and one which will consider a probability in the running example here we have our students where blue is accepted and red is rejected and the dis critical algorithm will tell us if a student is accepted rejecting but I was tipping at zero for rejected students and a one for accept students on the other hand the farther a point is from the black line the more drastic these probabilities are points are well into the blue area get very high probabilities such as this point with an 85 percent probability of being blue and points are well into the red region are given very low probabilities such as this point on the bottom that is given a 20% probability of being blue the points over the line are all given a 50% probability of being blue as you can see the probability is a function of the distance from the line the way we move from discrete predictions to continues is to simply change your activation function from the step function on the left to the sigmoid function on the right the sigmoid function is simply a function which for large positive numbers will give us values very close to 1 for large negative numbers will give us values very close to 0 and for numbers that are close to 0 it'll give you the values that are close to 0.5 the formula is sigmoid FX equals 1 divided by 1 plus e to the minus X so before our model consisted of a line with a positive region and a negative region now it consists of an entire probability space where for each point in the plane we're given the probability that the label of the point is 1 for the blue points and 0 for the red points for example for this point the probability of being blue is 50% and of being read as 50% for this point the probabilities are 40% for being blue and 60% for being red for this one over here it's 30% for blue and 70% for red and for this point all over here it's 80% for being blue and 20% for being red the way we obtain this probability space is very simple we just combine the linear function WX plus B with the sigmoid function so in the left we have the lines that represent the points for which WX plus B is 0 1 2 minus 1 minus 2 etc and once we apply the sigmoid function to each of these values in the plane we then obtain numbers from 0 to 1 for each point these numbers are just the probabilities of the point being blue the probability of the point being blue is the prediction of the model Y hat which is sigmoid of WX plus B here we can see the lines for which the prediction is 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.4 0.3 etc as you can see as we get more into the blue area sigmoid of W X plus B gets closer and closer to 1 and as we move into the red area Sigma WX + B get closer and closer to 0 when we're over the main line WS plus B is 0 which means sigmoid of WS plus B is exactly 0.5 so here on the Left we have our old perceptron where the activation function is a step function and on the right we have our new perceptron where the activation function is the sigmoid function what a new perception does it takes the inputs multiplies them by the weights in the edges and adds the results then applies the sigmoid function so instead of returning 1 and 0 like before it returns values between 0 & 1 such as 0.99 or student got accepted or not and now it says the probability that the student got accepted is this much
