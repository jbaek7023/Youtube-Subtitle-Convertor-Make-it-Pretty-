now you may be wondering what happens if we have more data columns so not just testing grades but maybe something else like the ranking of the student in the class how do we fit three columns of data well the only difference is that now we won't be working in two dimensions we'll be working in three so now we have three axis X 1 for the test X 2 for the grades and X 3 for the class ranking and our data will look like this like a bunch of blue and red points flying around in 3d on our equation won't be aligned in two dimension but a plane in three dimensions with a similar equation as before now the equation will be W 1 X 1 plus W 2 X 2 plus W 3 X 3 plus B equals 0 which will separate the space into two regions this equation can still be abbreviated by WX plus B equals 0 except our vectors will now have 3 entries instead of 2 and our prediction will still be y hat equals 1 if W X plus B is greater than or equal to 0 and 0 of WX plus B is less than 0 and what if we have many columns like say n of them well it's the same thing now our data just leaves an n-dimensional space now I have trouble picturing things in more than three dimensions but if we can imagine that the points are just things with in coordinates called X 1 X 2 X 3 all the way up to X n with our labels being Y then our boundary is just an N minus 1 dimensional hyper plane which is the high dimensional equivalent of a line in 2d or a plane in 3d and the equation of this n minus 1 dimensional hyper plane is going to be w1 x1 plus w2 x2 plus all the way to WN xn plus B equals 0 which we can still abbreviate to W X plus B equals 0 where our vectors now have n entries and our prediction is still the same as before it is y hat equals 1 if W X plus B is greater than or equal to 0 and Y hat equals 0 if WS plus B is less than 0
