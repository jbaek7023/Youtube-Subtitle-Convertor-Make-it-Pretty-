 so first let's add some math we're going to label the horizontal axis corresponding to the test by the variable x1 and the vertical axis corresponding to the grades by the variable x2 so this boundary line that separates the blue and the red points is going to have a linear equation the one drawn has equation 2 x1 plus x2 minus 18 equals 0 what does this mean this means that our method for accepting or rejecting students simply says the following take this equation as our score the score is 2 times test plus grades minus 18 and when the student comes in we check their score if their scores a positive number then we accept the student and if the score is a negative number then we reject the student this is called a prediction we can say by convention that if the score is 0 we'll accept a student although this won't matter much at the end and that's it that linear equation is our model in the more general case our boundary will be an equation of the form w1 x1 plus w2 x2 plus B equals 0 will abbreviate this equation in vector notation as WX plus B equal to 0 where W is the vector W 1 W 2 and X is the vector X 1 X 2 and we simply take the product of the two vectors we'll refer to X as the input to W as the weights and to B as the bias now for a student coordinates x1 x2 will denote the label is y and the label is what we're trying to predict so if the student gets accepted namely the point is blue then the label is y equals 1 and if the student gets rejected namely the point is red and the label is y equals 0 thus each point is in the form X 1 X 2 Y or Y is 1 for the blue points and 0 for the red points and finally our prediction is going to be called Y hat and it will be what the algorithm predicts that the label will be in this case Y hat is one of the algorithm predicts that the student gets accepted which means the point lies over the line and Y hat is 0 if the algorithm predicts that the student get rejected which means the point is under the line in math terms this means that the prediction Y hat is 1 if W X plus B is greater than or equal to 0 and zero of WX plus B is less than zero so to summarize the points above the line have y hat equals one and the points below the line have y hat equals zero and the blue points have y equals one and the red points have y equals zero and the goal of the algorithm is to have Y hat resembling Y as closely as possible which is exactly equivalent to finding the boundary line that keeps most of the blue points above it and most of the red points below it
